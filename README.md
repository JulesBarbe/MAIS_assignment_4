# Mais_A4
 Mais 202 bootcamp assignment 4

 Our try at a CNN implementation for the MAIS 202 bootcamp assignment 4.

 The model (hopefully) recognizes the maximum digit in a 128x128 grayscaled image containing 3 digits and random noise.
 Implemented with basic preprocessing, custom digit localization function and (shady) keras functional API implementation of a multi-input CNN model.
 
 Implemented through Jupyter notebook, just add the dataset in the folder and let it run!
